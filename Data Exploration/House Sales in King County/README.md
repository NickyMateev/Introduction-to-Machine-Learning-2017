# What the heck is this?

Well... long story short - this is my first ever attempt at Machine Learning data exploration and model training... ever.

Like most people just starting out, I've used Linear regression to try and train a model which performs fairly well. I'll be updating the uploaded notebook periodically in an attempt to make the model even more accurate.


The dataset being used is taken from Kaggle and can be found here: [CLICK][1]
